## Like Likert, But More So

As I scanned the expertise questions in your posting, it felt a little eerie how well my non-traditional amalgam of experience and skill seemed to fit the bill. Here's a little more info that I hope will get your curiosity piqued, too.

  Teams come in many shapes and sizes, and I've led a bunch of them. From twenty
  people working together in a fancy restaurant to multi-site collaborative
  efforts among academic medical research groups, I've seen first-hand that
  shared passion is an effort multiplier like no other.

  I can scrub a general ledger, compile and explain a P&L, manage controllables,
  plan budgets across five years, surface meaningful insights from complicated
  data, and a whole lot more. At the Department of Family Medicine and Community
  Health at UPenn, this has been my primary responsilibity for the last 4.5
  years.

  I'm a few weeks away from finishing my master's degree in computer science
  from the University of Pennsylvania. I've been doing a lotta software
  engineering across a range of discplines.

  I'm proud to have been the lead in taking French Broad Chocolates in
  Asheville, North Carolina from a mom & pop brick & mortar serving a local
  community to a national purveyor of fine chocolates. Perishable foods
  (especially in heat!) like chocolate require extra attention and care,
  especially when minimizing the environmental impact of packaging materials is
  a priority. A wonderful way to spend the second half of my twenties -- and the
  staff meals were to die for.

  I've been paid to travel the country sourcing vintage RCA and Western Electric
  audio equipment from the 1940s (mostly from hidden projection booths in 80
  year old theaters long since converted to churches and / or porn houses) which
  were then exported through Chicago for retail to collectors in China. This
  isn't strictly relevant to this position, it's just a super specific and kinda
  neat job that I never get to talk about. Beyond my experience keeping
  chocolate cold in summer from North Carolina to Arizona and keeping Costa
  Rican customs from spraying organic cacao with pesticides in port, I don't
  have a lot of supply chain and logistical experience.

  I haven't yet worked with influencers for marketing stuff. That said, managing
  restaurants is a non-stop public relations job, while securing buy-in from a
  broad range of high-powered stakeholders for behavioral health initiatives in
  academic medicine taught me how to manage up, meet people where they are. And
  hey, I once designed an opioid-use disorder buprenorphine treatment onboarding
  toolkit that the Surgeon General thought was good.
