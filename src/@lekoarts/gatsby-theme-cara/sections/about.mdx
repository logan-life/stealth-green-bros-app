## What is your level of interest in doing things differently, even if it's harder?

Hey, I built a bespoke website just for this opportunity!

I don't measure stuff I want to do on an Easy <-----> Hard axis.

If I want to do it, if I have or can acquire the skills to do it, and if it will have a positive impact on the world?

Then I'm down to strive together, and trust that my team and I will surmount the barriers and roadblocks as they come.
