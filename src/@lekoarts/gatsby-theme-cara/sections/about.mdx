## Q: What is your level of interest in doing things differently, even if it's harder?

Hey, I built a bespoke website just for this opportunity! ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚

In truth, I tend not to measure stuff I want to do on an Easy <-----> Hard axis.
If I want to do a thing, if I have (or can acquire) the skills to do the thing, and if the thing will have a positive impact on the world?
Then I'm down to strive together, and trust that my team and I will surmount the barriers and roadblocks as they come.

I'm passionate about service to others, fighting for a sustainable planet, reducing human work burdens, and a lot more.

My time in financial analysis and administration has taught me business acumen and how to balance competing priorities.

My time in the service and hospitality industry has instilled in me patience for others and a deep sense of respect for the value of my team.

My time in community medicine and population health has helped me better understand the needs of underserved and oppressed peoples and fostered a committment to service.

My time in computer science programs has equipped me with the skills to interface with an increasingly technology-driven world while retaining the ability to communicate technical information to non-technical audiences.

I'm searching for a worthwile endeavor to finally bring all of this experience together to change the world for the better. I think this might be that thing.
